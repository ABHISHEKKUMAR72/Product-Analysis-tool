## 🎯 Advanced Features Explained

### 🤖 AI-Powered Recommendations (`recommendation_engine.py`)
Uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to find products similar to your selection based on:
- Price range
- Rating distribution
- Product characteristics
Helps users discover alternatives that match their budget and quality expectations.

### 💬 Sentiment Analysis (`sentiment.py`)
Analyzes **product reviews and ratings** to determine:
- Overall sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
- Consumer satisfaction levels
- Review credibility scores
Real-world implementation integrates with HuggingFace transformers for NLP analysis.

### ⭐ Value Scoring (`value_scorer.py`)
Intelligently scores products (0-100) by analyzing:
- **Specs extraction** → RAM, Storage, Battery, Screen size, etc.
- **Price-to-specs ratio** → Better value = higher score
- **Rating weight** → Quality assurance factor
- **Market positioning** → Competitive pricing comparison
Helps identify the best value products in your search results.

### 🔔 Price Alerts (`alerts.py`)
- **Set custom price targets** for any product
- **Email notifications** when prices drop below target
- **Persistent storage** in SQLite database
- **Track multiple products** simultaneously
Uses event-driven notifications to keep you informed of deals.

### 🔄 Product Comparison (`compare.py`)
- **Side-by-side comparison** of multiple products
- **Feature extraction** from titles and descriptions
- **Price trend analysis** for selected products
- **Visual charts** for easy decision-making
Simplifies multi-product evaluation.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning (`data_cleaner.py`)
- **Outlier detection** → Removes suspiciously priced items
- **Data validation** → Ensures price and rating accuracy
- **Missing value handling** → Graceful degradation
- **Duplicate removal** → Prevents inflated search results
Ensures high data quality for analysis.

### 🛡️ Anti-Bot Protection (`anti_bot.py`)
- **Adaptive scraping** → Changes user agents & headers
- **Request throttling** → Avoids detection by rate-limiting
- **Proxy rotation** (future enhancement)
- **Session management** → Appears as legitimate user traffic
Maintains scraping stability while respecting platform policies.

### ⚙️ Smart Caching (`caching_service.py`)
- **In-memory caching** of recent search results
- **Database query optimization** → Faster data retrieval
- **TTL-based expiration** → Fresh data after timeout
- **Performance metrics** → Tracks cache hit/miss rates
Improves user experience with faster load times.

### 🦅 PriceHawk Chrome Extension (`extension/`)
- **BuyHatke-Style Utility:** Reads the product you are currently viewing and fetches lowest prices across the internet.
- **Manifest V3:** Modern Chrome extension architecture with strict security.
- **REST API Driven:** Calls Python Flask backend to offload all heavy scraping work.
- **Premium UI:** Designed with dark-mode aesthetic, micro-animations, and visual product cards.

### ⚡ Fast Async Scraper (`fast_scraper.py`)
- **Parallel Playwright Instances:** Uses a single browser session to query up to 7 platforms concurrently.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Only getting results from Amazon and Myntra, not Flipkart/Meesho
**Root Cause:** Website selectors change frequently. The scrapers use CSS/XPath selectors that may become outdated.

**Solution:** 
1. **Ensure you're using the latest version** of the code with improved selectors (check Scraper.py was updated)
2. **Check your internet connection** - some sites block automated requests
3. **Try searching for simpler queries** first (e.g., "phone" instead of "latest iPhone 15 pro")
4. **Increase wait time:** Edit `Scraper.py` and change `time.sleep(3)` to `time.sleep(5)` for slower connections
5. **Check browser compatibility:** Install latest ChromeDriver
   ```bash
   python -m webdriver_manager chrome
   ```

**If still getting blank results for specific platforms:**
- Open browser in non-headless mode to debug: Change `headless=True` to `headless=False` in `app.py` line 75
- Watch the browser and note any errors that appear
- This helps identify if the website structure changed

### Issue: "selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException"
**Solution:** Update webdriver-manager  
```bash
pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager
python -m webdriver_manager chrome
```

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn'"
**Solution:** Install scikit-learn  
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Issue: Port 5000 already in use
**Solution:** Change the port in `app.py`  
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=8000)  # Change to any free port
```

### Issue: Scraper is slow or getting blocked
**Solution:** The anti-bot module adds delays and changes headers automatically. Check:
- Internet connection speed
- Website's robots.txt policies
- Try searching for simpler/fewer keywords
- Increase the delay in `components/anti_bot.py` if sites are blocking you

### Issue: Compare feature not showing products from specific platforms
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you've selected multiple platforms in the search form
2. Wait for all scrapers to complete (check console output for which platform is running)
3. The compare feature uses KNN algorithm - it finds similar products based on price & rating from ALL selected platforms
4. If a platform didn't return enough results, comparison will be limited to available products
